# Advanced AI Capabilities

This document describes the advanced AI capabilities implemented in this system, focusing on ensemble methods, genetic algorithms, uncertainty quantification, and adaptive learning rate schedules.

## 1. Ensemble Methods

Ensemble methods combine multiple models to improve prediction accuracy, robustness, and reliability. Our implementation supports:

### 1.1 Available Ensemble Methods
- **Voting Ensemble**: Combines predictions from multiple models by simple or weighted averaging
- **Stacking Ensemble**: Uses a meta-model to learn how to best combine the predictions from multiple base models
- **Weighted Ensemble**: Assigns different weights to each model based on performance or domain expertise

### 1.2 Key Features
- Support for heterogeneous model types (RL models, LSTMs, sklearn models)
- Uncertainty estimation for predictions
- Automatic snapshot models for ensembling

### 1.3 API Endpoints
- `POST /ensemble/create`: Create a new ensemble model
- `GET /ensemble/list`: List available ensemble models
- `POST /ensemble/backtest/<ensemble_name>`: Backtest an ensemble model

### 1.4 Usage Example
```python
import requests
import json

# Create an ensemble
response = requests.post(
    "http://localhost:5001/ensemble/create",
    json={
        "ticker": "AAPL",
        "models": ["models/ppo/ppo_AAPL.zip", "models/a2c/a2c_AAPL.zip"],
        "weights": [0.6, 0.4],
        "method": "weighted"
    }
)
print(response.json())

# List available ensembles
response = requests.get("http://localhost:5001/ensemble/list")
print(response.json())

# Backtest an ensemble
response = requests.post(
    "http://localhost:5001/ensemble/backtest/ensemble_AAPL",
    json={
        "ticker": "AAPL",
        "start_date": "2022-01-01",
        "end_date": "2022-12-31",
        "include_uncertainty": True
    }
)
print(response.json())
```

## 2. Genetic Algorithms for Strategy Evolution

Genetic algorithms (GAs) are optimization techniques inspired by natural evolution. They can evolve trading strategies by finding optimal parameters and configurations.

### 2.1 Available Strategy Types
- **MovingAverageCrossover**: Evolves short and long window parameters for MA crossover strategies
- **RLModelParameters**: Evolves hyperparameters for RL models (learning rate, batch size, etc.)

### 2.2 Key Features
- Population-based optimization with crossover and mutation
- Elitism to preserve best strategies
- Detailed evolution tracking and visualization
- Fitness function customization

### 2.3 API Endpoints
- `POST /genetic/optimize`: Start genetic optimization for a strategy
- `GET /genetic/list`: List available genetically optimized strategies

### 2.4 Usage Example
```python
import requests
import json

# Optimize a strategy using genetic algorithm
response = requests.post(
    "http://localhost:5001/genetic/optimize",
    json={
        "ticker": "MSFT",
        "strategy_type": "ma_crossover",
        "population_size": 50,
        "generations": 20
    }
)
print(response.json())

# List available optimized strategies
response = requests.get("http://localhost:5001/genetic/list")
print(response.json())
```

## 3. Uncertainty Quantification in Predictions

Uncertainty quantification provides confidence measures for model predictions, essential for risk management and decision-making in trading.

### 3.1 Available Uncertainty Methods
- **Bayesian Dropout**: Uses Monte Carlo dropout for Bayesian approximation
- **Bootstrap Ensemble**: Trains multiple models on bootstrapped samples
- **Quantile Regression**: Predicts distribution quantiles for uncertainty estimation

### 3.2 Key Features
- Prediction intervals with confidence levels
- Uncertainty visualization
- Calibration metrics and plotting
- Aleatoric vs. epistemic uncertainty separation

### 3.3 API Endpoints
- `POST /uncertainty/train`: Train a model with uncertainty quantification
- `GET /uncertainty/list`: List available uncertainty models

### 3.4 Usage Example
```python
import requests
import json

# Train a model with uncertainty quantification
response = requests.post(
    "http://localhost:5001/uncertainty/train",
    json={
        "ticker": "GOOG",
        "model_type": "bayesian_dropout",
        "lookback": 10
    }
)
print(response.json())

# List available uncertainty models
response = requests.get("http://localhost:5001/uncertainty/list")
print(response.json())
```

## 4. Adaptive Learning Rate Schedules

Adaptive learning rate schedules dynamically adjust the learning rate during training to improve convergence and performance.

### 4.1 Available Schedulers
- **Cyclic Learning Rate**: Cycles the learning rate between boundaries with a fixed frequency
- **Adaptive Learning Rate**: Reduces learning rate when performance plateaus
- **Cosine Annealing**: Gradually reduces learning rate following a cosine curve, with optional warm restarts

### 4.2 Key Features
- Support for TensorFlow/Keras, PyTorch, and Stable Baselines3 models
- Learning rate visualization
- Performance correlation analysis
- Automated warmup phase detection

### 4.3 API Endpoints
- `POST /adaptive_lr/train`: Train a model with adaptive learning rate
- `GET /adaptive_lr/list`: List available models trained with adaptive learning rates

### 4.4 Usage Example
```python
import requests
import json

# Train a model with adaptive learning rate
response = requests.post(
    "http://localhost:5001/adaptive_lr/train",
    json={
        "ticker": "TSLA",
        "model_type": "lstm",
        "scheduler_type": "cyclic"
    }
